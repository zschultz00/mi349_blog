            <p>After Zachary Schultz transferred to Michigan State University (MSU) from Oakland University, he got
                involved with research at SPARTIE Lab. On one of his first days as a transfer student, Zachary was
                sitting in MI 101. Dr. Ratan, the professor for MI 101, mentioned his podcast. After class Zachary went
                on YouTube to listen to some episodes of the podcast and he was immediately interested in the virtual
                reality research Dr. Ratan conducts. Fast forward and Zachary began getting involved doing research
                within SPARTIE Lab, Dr. Ratan’s lab. Zachary quickly became immersed in cutting edge virtual reality
                research. He worked with other undergraduate students assisting graduate students to develop a
                simulation for an experiment using Unity. Zachary and some of the other undergraduates wanted to share
                the super interesting research happening at SPARTIE Lab. MSU has a forum for undergraduates to share
                their research called University Undergraduate Research and Arts Forum (UURAF). Zachary designed a
                poster to describe the virtual reality experiment and the development tools the group uses. Zachary also
                took on an independent side research project looking into existing research regarding potential health
                risks associated virtual reality technologies. He turned his findings another poster. Zachary presented
                both posters at UURAF. As of October 2022, one of his research posters is on display within the College of
                Communication Arts and Sciences building at MSU. Zachary is still a member of SPARTIE Lab engaging with
                Virtual Reality research.</p>

            <p>Zachary cofounded Spartan Linux Users Group (SLUG) Fall semester 2021. Zachary and his peers gathered due
                to their shared interest of Linux. The group quickly registered as a student organization at Michigan
                State University (MSU). Due to the club forming in the middle of a semester membership was slow to grow.
                Eventually the club began to have more members join after Zachary and another member of the eBoard began
                promoting the club. The club was promoted with poster spread across MSU’s campus and at a student club
                event called Sparticipation. At Sparticipation Zachary engaged with many MSU students telling them about
                all of the exciting things the club does. SLUG’s main project has been establishing mirrors of popular
                Linux distributions (e.g., Arch Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu). The club is working to get the mirrors
                officially recognized. In addition to their mirrors, the club meets every other week to have fun
                discussing Linux related news. We also enjoy sharing our knowledge with each other and our personal
                Linux projects. As gaming on Linux becomes more common due to the Steam Deck, made by Valve, the club
                has been sharing excited to discuss how to get the best gaming experience on Linux. Information about
                SLUG can be found at <a href=https://mirrors.egr.msu.edu>https://mirrors.egr.msu.edu</a>.</p>
